# Meal Plan Optimizer

I recieve a daily allowance from my meal plan but money not spent by the end of the day goes bye bye. This script determines the ideal amount of items to buy in order to minimize lost money.


The current data set is market prices at the SDSU Aztec Market.

- Side Note:
Even by optimizing my daily purchases and never losing a cent I am still losing 345.4$ simply by being forced to use a meal plan
